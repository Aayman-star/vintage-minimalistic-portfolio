MDX is a powerful format that allows you to write JSX (React components) in Markdown documents. It combines the simplicity of Markdown with the flexibility of React, making it a popular choice for building content-driven websites. In this tutorial, we’ll cover the basic text structures you can use in MDX.

### Headings

Headings in MDX work just like in Markdown. Use `#` for the main heading and add more `#` symbols for subheadings.

```mdx
# This is an H1 heading

## This is an H2 heading

### This is an H3 heading
```

This is a paragraph in MDX. You don't need any special syntax to create a paragraph, just write your text.

This is another paragraph, and it will be rendered separately from the first one.

### Lists

MDX supports both ordered and unordered lists.

Unordered Lists
Use \*, -, or + followed by a space to create an unordered list.

- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

### Ordered Lists

For ordered lists, simply use numbers followed by a period.

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Code Blocks

To include code blocks in MDX, use triple backticks (```) or indent your code by four spaces. You can also specify the language for
syntax highlighting.

```javascript
const greet = () => {
  console.log("Hello, MDX!");
};
```

For inline code, use single backticks:

```mdx
This is inline code: `const x = 10;`
```

### Blockquotes

Blockquotes are great for emphasizing certain parts of your text. Just use > before the line of text.

> This is a blockquote. It’s used to highlight a quote or an important piece of information.

### Links and Images

Links in MDX are created using the [text](URL) syntax.

### JSX in MDX

One of the key features of MDX is the ability to include JSX (React components) directly in your content. This allows you to add
interactive elements or custom styles.

### Embedding YouTube Videos

You can embed YouTube videos or any iframe content directly using JSX:

<iframe
  width="560"
  height="315"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen
/>
