Writing clean code is more than just a technical skill; it's an art form. Clean code is code that is easy to read, understand, and
maintain. When writing clean code, it's essential to focus on clarity and simplicity, ensuring that others (or even your future self)
can pick up your code and immediately grasp its purpose. As the famous computer scientist Martin Fowler once said, "Any fool can write
code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."

One fundamental principle of clean code is the use of meaningful names. Variables, functions, and classes should have names that clearly
describe their purpose. For example, instead of naming a variable `a`, `b`, or `c`, opt for names like `userAge`, `totalPrice`, or
`calculateDiscount`. This practice might seem trivial, but it greatly enhances the readability of your code.

```javascript
// Bad
const a = 25;
const b = 100;

// Good
const userAge = 25;
const totalPrice = 100;
```

Another critical aspect of clean code is keeping functions small and focused. A function should do one thing and do it well.
If a function is trying to handle multiple responsibilities, it becomes difficult to test and maintain. By breaking down functions into
smaller, single-purpose units, you create code that is easier to debug and extend.

```
// Bad
function processOrder(order) {
  validateOrder(order);
  calculateTotal(order);
  applyDiscount(order);
  generateInvoice(order);
  sendConfirmationEmail(order);
}

// Good
function processOrder(order) {
  validateOrder(order);
  const total = calculateTotal(order);
  const discountedTotal = applyDiscount(total);
  const invoice = generateInvoice(order, discountedTotal);
  sendConfirmationEmail(order, invoice);
}

```

Lastly, writing clean code involves adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. Avoid duplicating code, as it can lead to
inconsistencies and make your code harder to maintain. Instead, encapsulate repeated logic in functions or classes, and reuse them
wherever needed. By doing so, you ensure that any changes only need to be made in one place, reducing the risk of errors.

```
// Bad
const calculateDiscountedPrice = (price, discount) => {
  return price - (price * (discount / 100));
};

const applyBlackFridayDiscount = (price) => {
  return price - (price * 0.5);
};

// Good
const applyDiscount = (price, discount) => {
  return price - (price * (discount / 100));
};

```
