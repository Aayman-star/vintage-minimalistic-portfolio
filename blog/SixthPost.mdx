This article outlines the sequence of gihub commands to follow.if you want to remove a file from the github repo.

The untracked files are easy to delete from the local repository,but once pushed to the remote repository,files cannot be deleted from the
local repo without causing errors in the synchrnocity of the two repos.So in such a situation one needs to remove the specific file from the
remote repository first.The following command fetches the latest changes made to the remote repository to enusre that the local
references are up to data. In simple words this command brings the local repo up to speed with the remote repo :

```
github fetch origin
```

Afterwards run the following command. this comand will fetch the names of all the files currently available on the mentioned branch.
Replace the <branch-name> with the branch you are working on :

```
git ls-tree -r <branch-name> --name-only
```

Now you can remove a certain file from the local repo with the following command:

```
git rm <file-path>
```

If at this point you wish to keep the file in the local repository ,you can alternatively use the followig command :

```
git rm --cached <file-path>
```

Now you can commit and push the change to the remote repository and the file will be removed from the remote repository:

```
git commit -m "Remove <file-path> from the repository"
git push origin main
```

At this point,if say,you want to delete the file or place it in the .gitignore files,you can do that.
