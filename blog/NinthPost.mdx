This tutorial will guide you through deploying a React app built with Vite to GitHub Pages. We’ll cover all the necessary steps,
including setting up your `vite.config.ts` and ensuring your deployment runs smoothly.

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js and pnpm Installed**: Ensure you have Node.js installed, and use `pnpm` as your package manager.
2. **A GitHub Account**: You need a GitHub account and a repository to host your React app.

## Step 1: Create and Configure Your React App

### 1. Create a New React App

If you haven’t already created your React app, start by running:

```bash
pnpm create vite
```

Follow the prompts to set up your project. Choose react as the framework.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies:

```
pnpm install
```

#### 3. Set Up vite.config.ts

In the root of your project, locate or create the vite.config.ts file. This file is used to configure Vite.

Update your vite.config.ts to ensure the build outputs to the correct directory and paths are set for GitHub Pages:

```
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  build: {
    outDir: 'dist', // Specify the output directory for the build
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        assetFileNames: 'assets/[name].[ext]',
        chunkFileNames: 'assets/[name].[hash].js',
        entryFileNames: 'assets/[name].[hash].js',
      },
    },
  },
  base: '/<repository-name>/', // Replace with your GitHub repository name
})

```

There is a simpler version to this as well,which is :

```
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";


export default defineConfig({
    /**Name of the output direcotory*/
  build: {
    outDir: "dist",
  },
  plugins: [react()],
  /*Name of the github repo*/
  base: "/gitbub-repo-name/",
});

```

Replace <repository-name> with the actual name of your GitHub repository.

### Step 2: Add the Homepage Field in package.json

In your package.json file, add a homepage field. This helps ensure paths are correctly resolved in production.

```
{
  "name": "your-app-name",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "homepage": "https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc -b && vite build",
    "predeploy": "pnpm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
  }
}

```

Replace <username> with your GitHub username and <repository-name> with your repository name.

### Step 3: Install the gh-pages Package

gh-pages is a package that simplifies deploying your app to GitHub Pages.

1. Install gh-pages
   Run the following command to add gh-pages as a dependency:

```
pnpm add gh-pages --save-dev

```

### Step 4: Update Your .gitignore

Ensure your .gitignore file does not ignore the dist directory since this is where your built files will reside.

Open .gitignore.
If dist/ is present, remove or comment out the line:

```
.gitignore files use "#" to comment the lines
#dist/
```

### Step 5: Build and Deploy Your App

1. Build Your App
   Run the following command to build your app:

```
pnpm run predeploy
```

This command compiles your app and outputs the files into the dist directory.

2. Deploy to GitHub Pages
   Once the build is successful, deploy your app using:

```
pnpm run deploy
```

This command pushes the contents of the dist directory to the gh-pages branch on GitHub, which GitHub Pages uses to serve your site.

### Step 6: Access Your Deployed App

1. Check the Deployment Status
   Navigate to your GitHub repository.
   Go to the Settings tab, then scroll down to the Pages section.
   Ensure that the source is set to the gh-pages branch, and your site is published.
2. Access Your Site
   Your app will be available at:

```
https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/
```

Replace **"<username>"** and **"<repository-name>"** with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

Step 7: Troubleshooting Common Issues
Blank Page After Deployment:

- Ensure the base option in vite.config.ts is correctly set to /<repository-name>/.
  Verify that the dist directory is correctly populated by the build process and not ignored in .gitignore.
  404 Errors for Assets:

- This usually indicates a path issue. Make sure the homepage and base configurations are correct.
  No dist Directory:

- If the dist directory isn’t created, ensure that pnpm run build is working without errors and that the outDir is correctly set in vite.config.ts.
